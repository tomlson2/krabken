# Krabken

Rust <> Kraken

### About
This is a work in progress for an easy to use Rust program that interacts with the Kraken Exchange. This is my second attempt at creating something substantial with Rust, so it won't be perfect. This project is helping me learn more about creating API calls, parsing data and working with data to get what I want.

### Functionality
- [x] Authenticate to Kraken using an encrypted API-Sign.
- [x] Build methods for client connection to get and post to the API.
- [x] Create structure for querying and storing market data.
- [ ] Trading functionality
- [ ] Build out technical analysis and data tools
- [ ] Manage requests and keep track of available requests before throttle
- [ ] Paper trading 
- [ ] Portfolio tracking 
- [ ] Graphical user interface for data display
